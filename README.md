# Robin Hood of FinTech

## Overview and Origin 

#### Robin Hood 

Robin Hood, the American financial services company, was first incorporated on April 13th, 2013. The company was founded by two entrepreneurs: Baiju Bhatt and Vladamir Tenev who first met at Stanford University in 2005. After teaming up on several ventures, they were inspired by the "occupy Wall Street movement" and wanted to create a company that would make finance more accessible. They named the company after the English outlaw that stole from the rich and gave to the poor. They happened to raise over 200 million dollars from the investment firm D1 Capital Partners. 


## Business Activities 

The reason Robin Hood has risen so dramatically in both size and popularity is due to its ability to solve a fundamental problem in the financial world: provide an internet stock trading platform the offers comisson free trading. Robin Hood's target market, mellennials, has been efficiently been reached out to in contrast to traditional financial banking institutions who do not particaularly cater to them. Robin Hood currently manages close to 20 billion dollars in assets throught their customers, which can be interpreted as their effective market size. One of the many advantages of Robin Hood include an easy-to-use trading app, as well as commission free trading options. This is something almost no other financial institution provides!

Robin Hood makes use of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides an on-demand cloud computing platforms and API's like JavaScript to individuals, companies, governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. The company uses AWS to operate its online business, deliver, and update its mobile trading app, secirely store customer information and trading data, and perform business analytics. 


## Financial Landscape
Robin Hood can be considered a part of a variety of Financial Industries, but it primarily falls under Digital Banking. Some effective major trends and innovations of the Digital Banking sector have been: data utilization, collaboration, platform economy, the "non traditional" players, and financial health. Some of the competitive threats that Robin Hood does face do not derive from the Ditial Banking sector itself, but from an different subdivision of Alternative Finance in the crypocurrency space called Coin Base. Some other notable competition include traditional financial banking services who provide lower prices than they do. Some of these include: Merrill Edge, TD Ameritrade, and many more. 


## Results and Recommendations 
Using the Robin Hood app, a lot of students have helped improve their undestanding of how stock trading works. Additionally, Robin Hood's growth has been exponential as well. Some of the greatest metricts used by financial banking systems is the implementation of new and rapidly evolving technologies. Based on their ability to change and sustain their changes, Robin Hood has been doing incredibly well. It is keeping with the face pace of technological changes and broadening their horizons through their financial services. Relative to other companies in the digital banking domain, there are a few competitors who provide better benefits and rates, such as TD Ameritrade, at extremly competitive rates as well. 

With the way things are going, the crypo market is going in increasing popularity over the past decade. As more people start investing into the crypto market, espcially with the upcoming genZ population on the rise, Robin Hood would need to work around to incorporate and compete with crypto firms such as Coin Base to diversify their risks. Some technologies they may want to consider to implement include Ethereum blockchain services, and other decentralised trading platforms as they gain popularity. As we move into the age of privacy and data security, technologies such as blockchain and decentralised systems provide the security that the people will soon demand, and will be the new frontier in this information age. Therefore, due to the apparent changes coming to the financial and web based services, I would recommend Robin Hood to move that direction.
